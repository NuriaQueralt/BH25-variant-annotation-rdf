# Introduction
<!-- In the DBCLS BioHackathon 2024, variant and CT projects. Precision oncology focus. -->

Our objective was to develop an RDF model for the GA4GH VRS v2 standard driven by the use case of matching patients to clinical trials.

# Related work
<!-- # GA4GH VRS, v1 -> v2 -->

<!-- # In the SWAT4HCLS BioHackathon 2025, -->

<!-- # CT models, RDF? -->

Our contributions to current research:
1. **GA4GH VRS RDF for semantic clinical trials**: .
2. **Structural variants representation**: .
3. **Precision oncology use case**: .

# Method
## Materials
- Use of standards
- Use case driven

## Collaborations
- **Pangenome graphs**:
- **Personalized medicine platform**:


# Results
## GA4GH VRS model

## Clinical trials model  

## Implementation of GA4GH VRS RDF schema v2

## Potential new use cases
1. **Structural variants representation**: From our collaboration with the _Pangenome graph_ group ... .
2. **Precision oncology**: From our collaboration with the _Platform for precision medicine_ group ... .


# Discussion

## Impact

1. **ERDERA**: .
2. **Pangenome graphs**: .
3. **Platform for precision medicine**: .
4. **GA4GH BRCA GIF**: .
5. **SWAT4HCLS community**: .

## Future work

- Update current GA4GH VRS RDF model expressed in ShEx to v2
- RDFization plan: Annotate variant data in the [Phenopackets store](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenopacket-store/blob/main/notebooks/ADA/phenopackets/PMID_28823388_3-month-oldgirl.json) and use [ShExML tool](https://shexml.herminiogarcia.com/) in a RDFization workflow.
